# Pill Pal (Full Stack Group Project for CodeStack Academy)

This is a final project for CodeStack Academy, where I worked as the "Product Manager/Team Lead" for a group project. I collaborated with two other classmates on this application. As the team lead, my responsibilities included creating a Jira board, organizing tasks, managing requirements, and designing the application using Notion and Figma. And I also focused mainly on the front-end code, while my classmate Griffin worked on the back-end, and Harrison worked on the front-end also.

>The Team:
>
>Brandon Le (Front-End/Team-Lead)
>
>Griffin Parker (Back-End)
>
>N. Harrison Wilkins (Front-End)

## About the Project

[Azure hosting for Pill Pal](https:pillpalapp.azurewebsites.net)

Pill Pal is an app that aims to provide users with a place to store medical information such as medication history, insurance details, allergies, doctor's contacts, and pharmacy contacts. While the current version of the app is not fully functional as initially planned, it serves as a prototype developed for the assignment within the given timeframe and project constraints.

## Setup and Installation

Please note that as this was a class assignment, the backend server required to fully utilize the application is not going to be publicly available or hosted to a database at the end of this project. However, you can still access and review the frontend code.

[Here is the backend repo if you'd like to see it.](https://github.com/Brand0nLe/pillpalbackend)

To run the frontend code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the site.
